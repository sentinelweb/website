<h4>1. What is process?</h4>
<p>
    In software when we refer to process we refer to <i>workflow</i>. Software projects (just like most other projects)
    are broken up into smaller units of work. There are many ways - but at the moment a lot of teams focus on
    <i>features</i>,
    which are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_feature">"A distinguishing characteristic of a software
    item"</a>.
    Features can then be broken up into <i>epics</i> and the epics further broken down into <i>tasks</i>. A task is
    something that can usually be be completed in a <i>sprint</i> - which is generally a 1 or 2 week work cycle where
    something is added to the software.
</p>
<p>
    Where process comes in is how to define these features & tasks - and also how to deliver them. The best process is
    one
    that makes sure that <i>everyone</i> working together on a task knows what needs to be done <i>with no
    misunderstandings</i>.
    The main things that go wrong with software development generally come down to problems with defining what needs to
    be done and when ... there can be misunderstandings with what the business wants,Ã¥ and the business can also
    misunderstand what their customers want.
</p>

<h4>2. Understanding requirements</h4>
<p>
    Before starting to build, it's important to make sure every stakeholder knows what the objective is - it sounds
    really simple, but in 25 years of software development - most of the delays I have seen are simply down to this -
    either misunderstanding customer requirements and having to change requirements later (which is harder than building
    it right the first time) or misunderstandings in what has been specified.
</p>
<p>
    So what are the ways to avoid these problems?
</p>
<h5>2.1 Working with customers</h5>
<p>Before starting to write any software a lot of time can be saved by thinks like:
<ul>
    <li><b>Conducting customer interviews</b> : Asking non-leading questions and seeing what ideas the customer has.
    </li>
    <li><b>Paper prototyping</b> : Simply drawing a UI on a piece of paper and seeing if someone can figure out what to
        do - and if they like it.
    </li>
    <li><b>Landing pages</b> : Making a fake homepage using your tagline and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_selling_proposition" title="Unique Selling Proposition">USP</a>.
        You can advertise this and see what the response is from the public by seeing if they sign up for a newsletter
        or
        click a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_to_action_(marketing)" title="Call to action">CTA button</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
Doing these simple things can help to give you the best idea of what you need - and can even change the direction of a project
at an early stage - saving valuable time.
</p>

<h5>2.2 Making a plan</h5>
<p>Once we have the requirements in place, we need to identify the features we want to build and prioritise them. Then
    break them down into smaller features and tasks and order them so that they can be delivered incrementally. This is
    where it is best to work with experienced developers - as it is very easy to underestimate what needs to be done and
    incur more time, costs and bugs.
</p>

<h4>3 Build and Refine</h4>
<p>
    The goal is to get something to market as soon a possible - this allows a process of continuous improvement to take
    place, where users, beta testers, and other stakeholders can provide feedback so that the most important things get
    done first and no time is wasted on things that people don't use.
</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>So we can see that it is best to do sufficient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_product_development"><i>Product
    development</i></a>
    before doing any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development"><i>Software development</i></a>. This
    saves much valuable time and makes the difference between success and failure
    in app development. Doing the simple things makes all the difference before diving into the harder tasks.
    Companies such as Trainline have got these things right, and it shows in their ability to constantly deliver
    high quality and useful functionality to customers.
