<h4>1. What is process?</h4>
<p>
    In software when we refer to process we refer to <i>workflow</i>. Software projects (just like most other projects)
    are broken up into smaller units of work. There are many ways but at the moment a lot of teams focus on
    <i>features</i>,
    which are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_feature">"A distinguishing characteristic of a software
    item"</a>.
    Features can then be broken up into <i>epics</i> and the epics further broken down into <i>tasks</i>. A task is
    something that
    can usually be be completed in a <i>sprint</i> - which is generally 1 or 2 week work cycle where something is added
    to
    the software.
</p>
<p>
    Where process come in is how to define these features & tasks and also how to deliver them. The best process is one
    that makes sure that everyone working together on a task knows what needs to be done with no misunsderstandings.
    The main things that go wrong with software development generally come down to problems with defining what needs to
    be done and when - there can be misunderstandings with what the business wants and the business can also
    misunderstand what their customers want.
</p>

<h4>2. Understanding requirements</h4>
<p>
    Before starting to build, its important to make sure every stakeholder knows what the objective is - it sounds
    really simple,
    but in 25 years of software development - most of the delays I have seen are simply down to this - either
    misunderstanding
    customer requirements and having to change requirements later (which is harder than building it right the first
    time)
    or misunderstandings in what has been specified.
</p>
<p>
    So what are the ways to avoid these problems?
</p>
<h5>2.1 Working with customers</h5>
<p>Before starting to write any software a lot of time can be saved by thinks like:
<ul>
    <li><b>Conducting customer interviews</b> : Asking non-leading question and seeing what ideas the customer has.</li>
    <li><b>Paper prototyping</b> : Simply drawing a UI on a piece of paper and seeing if someone can figure out what to
        do and if they like it.
    </li>
    <li><b>Landing pages</b> : Making a fake homepage sting you tagline and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_selling_proposition" title="Unique Selling Proposition">USP</a>.
        You can advertise this and see what the response is from the public by seeing if they sign up for a newsletter
        or
        click a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_to_action_(marketing)" title="Call to action">CTA button</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
Doing these simple things can help to give you the best idea of what you need - and can change the direction of a project
at an early stage - saving valuable time.
</p>

<h5>2.2 Making a plan</h5>
<p>Once we have the requirements in place we need to identify the features we want to build an prioritise them, break
    them down
    into smaller features and tasks and order them so that they can be deliverd incrementally. This is where it is best
    to work
    with experienced developers as it is very easy to undrestimate what needs to be done and incurr more time, costs and
    bugs.
</p>

<h4>3 Build and refine</h4>
<p>
    The goal is to get something to market as soon a possible - this allows a process of continuous improvement to take
    place, where
    users, beta testers, and other stakeholders can provide feedback so that the most important things get done first
    and no time is
    wasted on things that people don't use.
</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>So we can see that it is best to do sufficient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_product_development"><i>Product development</i></a>
    before doing any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development"><i>Software development</i></a>. This save much valuable time and makes the difference between success and failure
    in app development. Doing the simple things makes all the difference before getting onto the harder things. Companies such as
    trainline have got these things right and it shows in their ability to constanly deliver high quality and useful functionality to customers.
